# SGD-Classifier
## AIM:
To write a program to predict the type of species of the Iris flower using the SGD Classifier.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import required libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn).

2. Load the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.

3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. Initialize the SGDClassifier with loss="log_loss" (for logistic regression).

5. Train the model using the training dataset.

6. Predict the species for the test dataset.

7. Evaluate model performance using accuracy score and classification report.
